abstract = {In a world increasingly connected, and in which information flows quickly and affects a very large number of people, sentiment analysis has seen a spectacular development over the past ten years. This is due to the fact that the explosion of social networks has allowed anyone with internet access to publicly express his opinion. Moreover, the emergence of big data has brought enormous opportunities and powerful storage and analytics tools to the field of sentiment analysis. However, big data introduces new variables and constraints that could radically affect the traditional models of sentiment analysis. Therefore, new concerns, such as big data quality, have to be addressed to get the most out of big data. To the best of our knowledge, no contributions have been published so far which address big data quality in SA throughout its different processes. In this paper, we first highlight the most important big data quality metrics to consider in any big data project. Then, we show how these metrics could be specifically considered in SA approaches and this for each phase in the big data value chain.},

abstract = {In recent years, as more and more data sources have become available and the volumes of data potentially accessible have increased, the assessment of data quality has taken a central role whether at the academic, professional or any other sector. Given that users are often concerned with the need to filter a large amount of data to better satisfy their requirements and needs, and that data analysis can be based on inaccurate, incomplete, ambiguous, duplicated and of poor quality, it makes everyone wonder what the results of these analyses will really be like. However, there is a very complex process involved in the identification of new, valid, potentially useful and meaningful data from a large data collection and various information systems, and is critically dependent on a number of measures to be developed to ensure data quality. To this end, the main objective of this paper is to introduce a general study on data quality related with big data, by providing what other researchers came up with on that subject. The paper will be finalized by a comparative study between the different existing data quality models.},

abstract = {As Big Data becomes better understood, there is a need for a comprehensive definition of Big Data to support work in fields such as data quality for Big Data. Existing definitions of Big Data define Big Data by comparison with existing, usually relational, definitions, or define Big Data in terms of data characteristics or use an approach which combines data characteristics with the Big Data environment. In this paper we examine existing definitions of Big Data and discuss the strengths and limitations of the different approaches, with particular reference to issues related to data quality in Big Data. We identify the issues presented by incomplete or inconsistent definitions. We propose an alternative definition and relate this definition to our work on quality in Big Data.},
